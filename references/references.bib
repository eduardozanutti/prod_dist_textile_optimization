   abstract = {The textile industry is a complex and dynamic system where structured decision-making processes are essential for efficient supply chain management. In this context, mathematical programming models offer a powerful tool for modeling and optimizing the textile supply chain. This systematic review explores the application of mathematical programming models, including linear programming, nonlinear programming, stochastic programming, robust optimization, fuzzy programming, and multi-objective programming, in optimizing the textile supply chain. The review categorizes and analyzes 163 studies across the textile manufacturing stages, from fiber production to integrated supply chains. Key results reveal the utility of these models in solving a wide range of decision-making problems, such as blending fibers, production planning, scheduling orders, cutting patterns, transportation optimization, network design, and supplier selection, considering the challenges found in the textile sector. Analyzing those models, we point out that sustainability considerations, such as environmental and social aspects, remain underexplored and present significant opportunities for future research. In addition, this study emphasizes the importance of incorporating multi-objective approaches and addressing uncertainties in decision-making to advance sustainable and efficient textile supply chain management.},

The proposed model considers sea-air intermodal transportation network in order to enhance the responsiveness and flexibility of the distribution planning. This framework aims at making the trade-off between two conflicting goals. The first objective function considers the minimization of the overall costs associated with production, distribution, inventory and backorders. The second goal is to enhance the customers' service level by maximizing the on-time deliveries over a tactical time horizon. Therefore, to solve the bi-objective model, the ε-constraint method is applied to generate efficient Pareto set of optimal solutions. In fact, the obtained Integer Linear Programming model (ILP), solved using LINGO 18.0 software optimization tool. Computational results are based on a real-life case study from a textile and apparel industry.

   abstract = {The present paper proposes an integrated production-distribution planning approach for a textile and apparel supply chain. Tactical and operational decisions are considered in the proposed multi-product and multi-period planning problem. Using a rolling horizon, the approach aims at defining optimal quantities to produce, to store and to deliver. The integration consists in coordinating informational flows between producer and retailer. Information sharing will allow the producer to estimate more accurately the future replenishment orders that may happen at the operational level and adjust production capacity requirements accordingly. For this purpose, a two-stage planning approach is devised; the first stage deals with the tactical level while the second stage deals with the operational level. The monthly decisions taken at the tactical planning level are accounted for in the operational planning considering a variable rolling horizon. Moreover, accurate forecasts of future replenishment orders are established based on information sharing and introduced in the operational planning to determine the weekly decisions. Linear programming models are used to build production and distribution plans at the tactical and operational levels. Using real-life data from a textile and apparel Tunisian firm, we show that producer-retailer coordination based on the sharing of current sales information, yields significant cost savings reaching up to 20% of the supply chain cost. These findings can only motivate the partnership between producer and retailer through reliable information sharing in joint tactical-operational and production-distribution planning.},

   abstract = {Production planning is a necessary process that directly affects the efficiency of production systems in most industries. The complexity of the current production planning problem depends on increased options in production, uncertainties in demand and production resources. In this study, a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer optimization model is developed to ensure production efficiency in uncertainty conditions and satisfy the requirements of sustainable development. The efficiency of the production system is ensured through objective functions that optimize backorder quantity, machine uptime and customer satisfaction. The other three objective functions of the proposed model are related to optimization of profits, emissions, and employment changing. The objective functions respectively represent the three elements of sustainable development: economy, environment, and sociality. The proposed model also assures the production manager’s discretion over whether or not to adopt production options such as backorder, overtime, and employment of temporary workers. At the same time, the resource limits of the above options can also be adjusted according to the situation of each production facility via the model’s parameters. The solutions that compromise the above objective functions are determined with the Chebyshev goal programming approach together with the weights of the goals. The model is applied to the multinational production system of a Southeast Asian supplier in the textile industry. The goal programming solution of the model shows an improvement in many aspects compared to this supplier’s manufacturing practices under the same production conditions. Last but not least, the study develops different scenarios based on different random distributions of uncertainty demand and different weights between the objective functions. The analysis and evaluation of these scenarios provide a reference basis for managers to adjust the production system in different situations. Analysis of uncertain demand with more complex random distributions as well as making predictions about the effectiveness of scenarios through the advantages of machine learning can be considered in future studies.},

   abstract = {This study deals with production and distribution planning for a textile and apparel supply chain. Given the seasonal nature of demand, global character of the textile and apparel supply chain, short life cycle of apparel products and demand unpredi ctability of trendy items, manufacturers require an efficient and flexible planning system that incorporates in-season replenishment orders with short lead time and preseason orders with medium lead time. A planning approach integrating tactical and operational decisions is proposed. Using a rolling horizon, the proposed approach determines the quantities to produce, store and deliver, which minimize the total production and distribution cost. At the tactical planning level, a percentage of production capacity is reserved in order to accommodate replenishment orders that are difficult to predict. Moreover, production of standardized items with predictable demand could be assigned to overseas low-cost sub contractors. For operational planning, local sub contracting and overtime could be used as options to address the unpredict ability of the demand tied to replenishment orders. Our results show that the proposed approach results in a 10% cost saving over current practice.},

Risk management is addressed by incorporating a risk measure into the stochastic programming model as a second objective function, which leads to a multi-objective optimization model. The objectives aim to simultaneously maximize the expected net profit and minimize the financial risk measured. Two risk measures are compared: the conditional-value-at-risk and the downside risk. As the considered objective functions conflict with each other’s, the problem solution is a front of Pareto optimal robust alternatives, which represents the trade-off among the different objective functions.

   abstract = {Production and distribution are two key decisions in supply chain planning. In order to achieve an effective operational performance, it is important for these two decisions to be integrated, especially in supply chains with low inventory levels. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer programming model to integrate production, inventory, distribution and routing decisions in a single framework. The model was inspired by small Brazilian furniture companies and focuses on production and distribution decisions at an operational level. In particular, we consider a scenario in which only one production line and one vehicle, which makes multiple trips over the planning horizon, are available to produce items and deliver final products, respectively. We also take into account some features rarely considered in the literature, but commonly found in real-world applications, such as producing and stocking multiple items, distribution routes extending over one or more periods, multiple time windows and customers’ due dates. Computational tests on a set of randomly generated instances were carried out using a well-known optimization software and six relax-and-fix heuristics, which explore different criteria for partitioning and fixing variables. We also implemented two hybrid heuristics in which an initial solution is first constructed and then fed into the optimization software to improve it. The results showed that one relax-and-fix and the two hybrid heuristics performed better than the solver on the largest instances.},

The model helps fashion apparel suppliers in making decisions concerning allocation of production orders to different production plants characterized by different lead times and production costs, and in proper time scheduling and sequencing of these production orders. The model aims at optimizing these decisions concerning objectives of minimal production costs and minimal tardiness. It considers several factors such as the stochastic nature of customer demand, differences in production and transport costs and transport times between production plants in different regions. Finally, the model is applied to a case study. The results of numerical computations are presented. The implications of the model results on different fashion related product types and delivery strategies, as well as the model's limitations and potentials for expansion, are discussed. Results indicate that the production planning model using conditional value at risk (CVaR) as the risk measure performs robustly and provides flexibility in decision analysis between different scenarios. © 2014 Abderrahim Ait-Alla et al.},
